*Hi there*, dear reader! My name is Miguel Singian--board certified data nerd\*. While I'm not hunched over my laptop tinkering with neural networks, you'll probably find me at the gym listening to Matt Fradd's *[Pints with Aquinas](https://pintswithaquinas.com/)* podcast.

Look around, stay a while, or send me an email on <migsingian@gmail.com> for a chat.

\* Not a real certification, though I wish it was.
