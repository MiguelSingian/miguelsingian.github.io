Tableau \| Dashboarding

Powerlifting is a very objective sport. That is, an athlete can know within a very small margin of error how they will perform in a meet.

This is part one of a two-part series. [Read part two here.](https://miguelsingian.github.io/works/2023/12/10/powerlifting_2.html)

Knowing this, I wanted to know how I'd stack up against the competition in my first meet.

I created a simple Tableau dashboard, where one can input their stats and their lift total, and see where along the curve they are versus other competitive IPF lifters around the world.

You can play with it out [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/miguel.singian/viz/HowCompetitiveismyPowerliftingTotalMVP/Dashboard). The data source is [OpenIPF](https://www.openipf.org/) (don't try to find me on there; I didn't go through with the meet ðŸ˜…).
